# Data Use Case Description Specification

A prototype standard or specification for describing use cases of data mapped to fields, so that instances can provide a machine-readable format to support evaluation of how well a particular dataset meets given use-case requirements.

The specification itself (everything in `schema/`) is licensed under the GPL version 3. Any documentation will be licensed under an appropriate license at the time of production.

## Examples

There is an in-progress example of the OCDS use case list under `/examples`. The original list was generated by using [flatten-tool](https://flatten-tool.readthedocs.io/) across [the original spreadsheet format of OCDS Use Cases](http://bit.ly/UsingIt-indicators) and tidying up the results a bit. The `ocds-indicators.json` file is the ongoing conversion to the "DUCDS" format.
